# mySIMBL

mySIMBL is a successor to the application EasySIMBL. This application uses my own version of SIMBL since both EasySIMBL and the original SIMBL no longer work properly on macOS 10.9 and above due to changes made by Apple. Since both projects seem to have been abandoned or left unsupported I have created mySIMBL. It is designed to make finding, updating and installing SIMBL plugins easier then ever.

# Installation

- Download the latest release
- Unzip the download if your browser does not do so automatically
- Open mySIMBL
    - mySIMBL will ask to be moved to /Applications
    - mySIMBL may ask to install or update SIMBL
    - You may be required to disable System Integrity Protection, mySIMBL will inform you but cannot automate this process

# Features
